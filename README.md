# Beeclick Tower Defense

Beeclick Tower Defense is somewhat of a successor to [Beeclick](https://beeclick.org/). However, while the clicking aspect is similar this provides a whole new challenge to those who wish to try.  

This was created during the 2022 Hacklahoma Event in a 24 hour time span using just HTML, CSS and Javascript!

## Gameplay

Beeclick TD, or BTD (no, this was not meant to be a reference to Balloons Tower Defense) focuses on the aspect of unity. The game has two stages, the clicking stage and defense stage.  

During the clicking stage, the players sole purpose is to gather as much honey as possible while ensuring maximum production. At the same time, they must also ensure they have enough money to survive the defense stage.  

The defense stage replicates a classic tower defense, where you must place towers to defend against oncoming waves of enemies. In this case, spiders.
